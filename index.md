## Welcome to your very own "treasure hunt"

I know, I can't be there to make you happy and do all the amazing things I had planned for you, but consider this as an appreciation for having you in my life and the fact that I cant be there is no reason I can't have something special for you.

And don't worry, I have a lot more for you as soon as I personally get to see you.

### Details

So now for some fun, here is all you need to know

**Treasure Hunt v.16.09.00 (shtit edition)**

# Welcome to your Birthday surprise,
Instead of blantantly just doing something cheesy for you, I thought what do I know about my girl in the past
one year of being together, that she loves adventure and doing something fun, so in an attempt of trying to 
do something out of the box, here is your very own treasure hunt.
Your challege, should you choose to accept it, is to go through a series of challenges, requiring nothing but 
your analytical skills and that sharp brain, to go through all the puzzles and brain teasers to arrive at the 
final stage, your surprise.
```

### ==>Some ground rules and facts:
1. You cannot skip any stage at the clues are all linked together.
2. Use your laptop to go through this as it would be easier and avoid any difficulty.
3. You start from this page, the very first stage. Followed by 4 levels with increasing difficulty.
4. If at any stage you get stuck you only get 2 clues(in total) from me, the creator of this challenge, to help 
   solve the challenge.
5. Little to no technical knowledge is needed for this challenge, primarily your analytical skills, so think in 
   that manner.
6. You need the answers for each round to help unlock the next one.
7. Oh, and one little thing, once you accept and start the challenge, you will have a 3 hour timer beginning, at 
   the end of which this page and the whole treasure hunt will shut down, and you will lose your birthday
   surprise. May the odds be with you.

## Round 1 - The law is anything but obvious
Why have we become enslaved to this one thing always in our hand, but no matter what, seems that it does
come in hand after all.

#####Now, I have a question for you, should you choose to answer

_You do not want to have it_

_but when you do have it,_

_you do not want to lose it._
